# OpenMessage

OpenMessage is a local-first messaging workspace for Google Messages and WhatsApp. Use it from the native macOS app, the localhost web UI, or any MCP-compatible client.

Built on [mautrix/gmessages](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages) (libgm) for the Google Messages protocol and [mcp-go](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go) for the MCP server.

## What it does

- **Google Messages for Mac** — pair your Android phone and read/send SMS + RCS locally
- **Live WhatsApp support** — link WhatsApp as a live companion device on your machine
- **One local inbox** — search, route-aware threads, media, reactions, drafts, and grouped contacts
- **macOS app + web UI** — native wrapper with notifications and contact photos, plus a localhost UI
- **MCP-ready** — expose the same local inbox to Claude Code and other MCP clients

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.22+** ([install](https://go.dev/dl/))
- **Google Messages** on your Android phone

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaxGhenis/openmessage.git
cd openmessage
go build -o openmessage .
```

### 2. Pair with your phone

```bash
./openmessage pair
```

By default, a QR code appears in your terminal. On your phone, open **Google Messages > Settings > Device pairing > Pair a device** and scan it. The session saves to `~/.local/share/openmessage/session.json`.

If Google only offers account pairing, you can also pair with Google account cookies copied from browser devtools:

```bash
pbpaste | ./openmessage pair --google
```

The CLI accepts either a JSON cookie object or a full `curl` command for `messages.google.com/web/config`, then prompts you to confirm an emoji on your phone.

### 3. Start the server

```bash
./openmessage serve
```

This starts both:
- **Web UI** at [http://127.0.0.1:7007](http://127.0.0.1:7007)
- **MCP SSE endpoint** at `http://127.0.0.1:7007/mcp/sse`

When `serve` is launched by an MCP client over pipes, it also serves MCP on stdio automatically.

### 3a. Optional: link WhatsApp

After `serve` is running, open the local UI and link WhatsApp from the Connections surface. OpenMessage keeps that bridge local and syncs it into the same inbox as Google Messages.

### 4. Connect to Claude Code

Add to `~/.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openmessage": {
      "command": "/path/to/openmessage",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code. The MCP tools appear automatically.

## MCP tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_messages` | Recent messages with filters (phone, date range, limit) |
| `get_conversation` | Messages in a specific conversation |
| `search_messages` | Full-text search across all messages |
| `send_message` | Send SMS/RCS to a phone number |
| `send_to_conversation` | Send a text reply directly to an existing conversation ID |
| `list_conversations` | List recent conversations |
| `list_contacts` | List/search contacts |
| `get_status` | Connection status and paired phone info |

## Web UI

The web UI runs at `http://localhost:7007` when the server is started. It provides:

- Conversation list with search and grouped multi-route contacts
- Message view with images, video, audio, reactions, and reply threads
- Route-aware compose and send
- Google Messages + WhatsApp connection controls
- Live typing indicators, read-state rendering, and notifications

## Native macOS app

The repo also includes a native Swift wrapper around the same local backend:

- embedded local OpenMessage backend
- native notifications
- contact photos
- the same Google Messages and WhatsApp pairing/runtime model as the web UI

The macOS app target lives under `OpenMessage/`.

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR` | `~/.local/share/openmessage` | Data directory (DB + session) |
| `OPENMESSAGES_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log level (debug/info/warn/error/trace) |
| `OPENMESSAGES_PORT` | `7007` | Web UI port |
| `OPENMESSAGES_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host/interface to bind the local web server to |
| `OPENMESSAGES_MY_NAME` | system user name | Display name for outgoing imported iMessage/WhatsApp messages |
| `OPENMESSAGES_STARTUP_BACKFILL` | `auto` | Startup history sync mode: `auto`, `shallow`, `deep`, or `off` |
| `OPENMESSAGES_MACOS_NOTIFICATIONS` | interactive macOS `serve` sessions only | Enable/disable native macOS notifications for fresh inbound live messages (`1`/`0`). Click-through opens the matching thread when `terminal-notifier` is available. |

## Architecture

- **libgm** handles the Google Messages protocol (pairing, encryption, long-polling)
- **whatsmeow** handles live WhatsApp pairing, sync, text/media send, receipts, typing, and avatars through a separate local session store
- **SQLite** (WAL mode, pure Go) stores messages, conversations, and contacts locally
- Real-time events from the phone are written to SQLite as they arrive
- The native macOS app and the localhost web UI run against the same local backend
- WhatsApp Desktop import remains as a fallback/repair path when the live bridge is not active
- On first run, a deep backfill fetches full SMS/RCS history in the background; later runs do a lighter incremental sync by default
- MCP tool handlers read from SQLite for queries and route sends through the same local runtime
- Auth tokens auto-refresh and persist to `session.json`

## Development

```bash
go test ./...        # Run all tests
go build .           # Build binary
npm install          # Install Playwright test runner
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e     # Run browser-level web UI tests
./openmessage pair  # Pair with phone
./openmessage serve # Start server
```
